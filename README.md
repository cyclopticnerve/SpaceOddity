# Installing

You should first run:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

to make sure you have the lastest repos and software installed.

You can download the (hopefully stable)
[latest release](http://github.com/danahynes/SpaceOddity/releases/latest) from 
the main branch, unzip it, and run the *install.py* file from there:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd Downloads/SpaceOddity-X.X.X
foo@bar:~/Downloads/SpaceOddity-X.X.X$ ./install.py
```

Or you can clone the git repo to get the latest (and often broken) code
from the dev branch:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd Downloads
foo@bar:~/Downloads$ git clone https://github.com/danahynes/SpaceOddity
foo@bar:~/Downloads$ cd SpaceOddity
foo@bar:~/Downloads/SpaceOddity$ ./install.py
```

# Uninstalling

You can run the uninstaller locally:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd .spaceoddity
foo@bar:~/.spaeoddity$ ./uninstall.py
```

Or you can download the (hopefully stable)
[latest release](http://github.com/danahynes/SpaceOddity/releases/latest) from 
the main branch, unzip it, and run the *uninstall.py* file from there:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd Downloads/SpaceOddity-X.X.X
foo@bar:~/Downloads/SpaceOddity-X.X.X$ ./uninstall.py
```

Or you can clone the git repo to get the latest (and often broken) code
from the dev branch:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd Downloads
foo@bar:~/Downloads$ git clone https://github.com/danahynes/SpaceOddity
foo@bar:~/Downloads$ cd SpaceOddity
foo@bar:~/Downloads/SpaceOddity$ ./uninstall.py
```

Or you can remove the files manually (note that this won't remove entries 
from your crontab, but it shouldn't hurt your system):

``` bash
foo@bar:~$ rm -rf "~/.spacoddity"
foo@bar:~$ rm -rf "~/.config/spaceoddity"
```
