create an install-latest script that formats current VERSION number, downloads,
    unzips, and runs installer
    https://gitbub.com/danahynes/SpaceOddity/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.0.zip
add to project notes in drive:
    do not change version number until ready for new release (breaks 
    install-latest script)


X note in readme that cloning gives you dev, latest gives you stable/main

X don't like the name install-cron.py - messes with tab complettion for 
    install.py

X in installer change pip command to use pip3

X ask for sudo after 'installing reqs' line

X note in readme to run update/upgrade before installer
