NEXT: use cp = subprocess.run() wherever possible
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
NEXT: should all the other stuff (caption, gui) be seperate scripts or just 
        import as modules?
NEXT: apod has not changed but user changed background manually
        don't force our wallpaper if URL has not changed
        but if enabled, want to put APOD in there
        ???
        download/set anyway even if url same
        or check gsettings url and change if different
        if we put our image in ~/.local/share/backgrounds, it will 
        show up in settings and user can change back to it?
NEXT: create an install-latest script that formats current VERSION number, downloads,
        unzips, and runs installer

NEXT: can we just put a file in  /etc/cron.d instead of all this python-crontab stuff?
        TimeShift does it, why not us?
NEXT: fix all vars to have type first (i.e. user_dict to dict_user)
