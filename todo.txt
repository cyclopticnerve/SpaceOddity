TODO: apod has not changed but user changed background manually
        don't force our wallpaper if URL has not changed
        but if enabled, want to put APOD in there
        ???
        download/set anyway even if url same
        or check gsettings url and change if different
        if we put our image in ~/.local/share/backgrounds, it will 
        show up in settings and user can change back to it?
TODO: finish json converter
TODO: test on VM

NEXT: create an install-latest script that formats current VERSION number, downloads,
    unzips, and runs installer
    https://gitbub.com/danahynes/SpaceOddity/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.0.zip
NEXT: can we just put a file in  /etc/cron.d instead of all this python-crontab stuff?
    TimeShift does it, why not us?
NEXT: fix all vars to have type first (i.e. user_dict to dict_user)
